# Cyb Virus
A Chrome extension to #fuckgoogle while you still on... Google

This slick extension is a Chrome-based app that can download any page you are browsing into IPFS "as is" - with one click!

Goodbye, Google! 

# Why
Few reasons:
- Because #fuckGoogle
- This is just an "in-between" instrument to show you the concept behind "true and free" browsing, even though it's not a "real" web 3 app
- You should own your content, not Google
- IPFS is just the place for that
- Own the web - don't let the web own you...

# Install
1. Execute commands
```
yarn
npm run watch:dev
```
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and install extension by folder ./dist

Or, simply go to [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cyb/kncpjlaiadkjhhdbddgjbjaijmdlhhkl?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) and click "Add to Chrome"
